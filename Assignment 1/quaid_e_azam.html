    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah </strong>  (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; <em>25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948</em>) was a barrister, politician, and <em>the founder of Pakistan</em>.
             Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the <em>inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947 </em> and then as Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.
            <br />
            Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a <em>barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England</em>. 
            Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.
             Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century.
             In these early years of his political career, <span>Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity</span>, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
             Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.
             In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            By <em>1940</em>, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they might be reduced to in an <em>independent Hindu–Muslim state</em>. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
             During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the <em>seats reserved for Muslims</em>.
             Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly <strong>Muslim state of Pakistan</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>As the first governor-general of Pakistan</strong>, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the <em>millions of Muslim migrants </em>who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps.
             <em>Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948</em>, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom.
             He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan.
             Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.
             He is revered in Pakistan as the <strong>Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader")</strong> and <strong>Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation")</strong>.
             His birthday is also observed as a national holiday in the country.
             According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.

    <h3>Early years</h3>
    <hr />
    <section>
        <h2>Family and childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Jinnah's given name at birth was <strong>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai</strong>, and he likely was <em>born in 1876</em>, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of <em>Wazir Mansion near Karachi</em>, now in Sindh, Pakistan, but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India.
             Jinnah's paternal grandfather <strong>lived in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula</strong> (now in Gujarat, India).
             He himself was a Khoja of Nizari Isma'ili Shia Muslim background from Gujarat, though he later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings.
             Jinnah would say that his ancestor was a Rajput from Sahiwal in Punjab who moved into Kathiawar after becoming a Khoja.
             After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background.
             His father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal; his mother was from the nearby<strong> village of Dhaffa</strong>.
             They had moved to <em>Karachi in 1875</em>, having married before their departure.
             Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in <em>1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles</em> closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay.
             Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah.
             Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent in English.
             Except for Fatima, <span>little is known of his siblings</span>, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have attended <strong>the Gokal Das Tej Primary School </strong>there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School.
             In Karachi, he attended the Sindh Madressatul Islam and the <strong>Christian Missionary Society High School</strong>. He gained his matriculation from <strong>Bombay University at the high school</strong>.
             In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination.
             His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, <em>writing in 1954</em>, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.
        </p>
        <h2>Education in England</h2>
        <p>
            In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London apprenticeship with his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.
             He accepted the position despite the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah.
             Jinnah's mother and first wife both died during his absence in England.
             Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah, one reason for sending him overseas was a legal proceeding against his father, which placed the family's property at risk of being sequestered by the court.
             <span>In 1893, the Jinnahbhai family moved to Bombay.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon after his arrival in London, Jinnah gave up the business apprenticeship in order to study law, enraging his father, who had, before his departure, given him enough money to live for three years.
             The aspiring barrister joined Lincoln's Inn, later stating that the reason he chose Lincoln's over the other Inns of Court was that over the main entrance to Lincoln's Inn were the names of the world's great lawgivers, including Muhammad.
             Jinnah's biographer Stanley Wolpert notes that there is no such inscription, but inside is a mural showing Muhammad and other lawgivers, and speculates that Jinnah may have edited the story in his own mind to avoid mentioning a pictorial depiction which would be offensive to many Muslims.
             Jinnah's legal education followed the pupillage (legal apprenticeship) system, which had been in force there for centuries.
             To gain knowledge of the law, he followed an established barrister and learned from what he did, as well as from studying lawbooks.
             During this period, he shortened his name to Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
        </p>
        <p>
            During his student years in England, Jinnah was influenced by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders.
             His main intellectual references were peoples like Bentham, Mill, Spencer, and Comte.
             This political education included exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and progressive politics.
             He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.
             Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central.
             Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Western world not only inspired Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal preferences, particularly when it came to dress.
             Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public.
             He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same silk tie twice.
             Even when he was dying, he insisted on being formally dressed, "I will not travel in my pyjamas."
             In his later years he was usually seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently came to be known as the "Jinnah cap".

    <h3>Legal and early political career</h3>
    <hr />
    <section>
        <h2>Barrister</h2>
        <p>
            At the age of 20, Jinnah began his practice in Bombay, the only Muslim barrister in the city.
             English had become his principal language and would remain so throughout his life.
             His first three years in the law, from 1897 to 1900, brought him few briefs.
             His first step towards a brighter career occurred when the acting <em>Advocate General</em> of Bombay, John Molesworth MacPherson, invited Jinnah to work from his chambers.
             In 1900, P. H. Dastoor, a <em>Bombay presidency magistrate</em>, left the post temporarily and Jinnah succeeded in getting the interim position.
             After his six-month appointment period, Jinnah was offered a permanent position on a 1,500 rupee per month salary.
             Jinnah politely declined the offer, stating that he planned to earn 1,500 rupees a day—a huge sum at that time—which he eventually did.
             Nevertheless, as <em>Governor-General of Pakistan</em>, he would refuse to accept a large salary, fixing it at 1 <em>rupee</em> per month.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a lawyer, Jinnah gained fame for his skilled handling of the 1908 <em>"Caucus Case"</em>.
             This controversy arose out of Bombay municipal elections, which Indians alleged were rigged by a "caucus" of Europeans to keep Sir <em>Pherozeshah Mehta</em> out of the council.
             Jinnah gained great esteem from leading the case for Sir Pherozeshah, himself a noted barrister.
             It was after his case that Jinnah posted a successful record, becoming well known for his advocacy and legal logic.
             In 1908, his factional foe in the <em>Indian National Congress, Bal Gangadhar Tilak</em>, was arrested for sedition.
             Before Tilak unsuccessfully represented himself at trial, he engaged Jinnah in an attempt to secure his release on bail.
             Jinnah did not succeed, but obtained an acquittal for Tilak when he was charged with sedition again in 1916.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of Jinnah's fellow barristers from the Bombay High Court remembered that "Jinnah's faith in himself was incredible"; he recalled that on being admonished by a judge with "Mr. Jinnah, remember that you are not addressing a third-class magistrate", Jinnah shot back, "My Lord, allow me to warn you that you are not addressing a third-class pleader."
             Another of his fellow barristers described him, saying:
        </p>
        <p>
            He was what God made him, a great pleader. He had a sixth sense: he could see around corners.
             That is where his talents lay ... he was a very clear thinker ... But he drove his points home—points chosen with exquisite selection—slow delivery, word by word.
        </p>
        <h2>Trade unionist</h2>
        <p>
            Jinnah was also a supporter of working class causes and an active trade unionist.
             He was elected President of All India Postal Staff Union in 1925 whose membership was 70,000.
             According to All Pakistan Labour Federation's publication Productive Role of Trade Unions and Industrial Relations, being a member of Legislative Assembly, Jinnah pleaded forcefully for rights of workers and struggled for getting a "living wage and fair conditions" for them.
             He also played an important role in enactment of Trade Union Act of 1926 which gave trade union movement legal cover to organise themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>Rising leader</h2>
        <p>
            In 1857, many Indians had risen <em>in revolt</em> against British rule.
             In the aftermath of the conflict, some Anglo-Indians, as well as Indians in Britain, called for greater self-government for the subcontinent, resulting in the founding of the <em>Indian National Congress</em> in 1885.
             Most founding members had been educated in Britain, and were content with the minimal reform efforts being made by the government.
             Muslims were not enthusiastic about calls for democratic institutions in <em>British India</em>, as they constituted a quarter to a third of the population, outnumbered by the Hindus.
             Early meetings of the Congress contained a minority of Muslims, mostly from the elite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jinnah devoted much of his time to his law practice in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904.
             He was a member of the moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and <em>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</em>.
             They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and <em>Lala Lajpat Rai</em>, who sought quick action towards independence.
             In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders, known as the Simla Delegation, headed by the <em>Aga Khan</em> called on the new <em>Viceroy of India, Lord Minto</em>, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the "unsympathetic [Hindu] majority".
             Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed.
             When many of the same leaders met in <em>Dacca</em> in December of that year to form the <em>All-India Muslim League</em> to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed.
             The Aga Khan later wrote that it was "freakishly ironic" that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, "came out in bitter hostility toward all that I and my friends had done ... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself."
             In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the <em>partition of Bengal</em>, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.
        </p>
        <h2>Farewell to Congress</h2>
        <p>
            Jinnah's moderate faction in the Congress was undermined by the deaths of Mehta and Gokhale in 1915; he was further isolated by the fact that Naoroji was in London, where he remained until his death in 1917.
             Nevertheless, Jinnah worked to bring the Congress and League together.
             In 1916, with Jinnah now president of the Muslim League, the two organisations signed the <em>Lucknow Pact</em>, setting quotas for Muslim and Hindu representation in the various provinces.
             Although the pact was never fully implemented, its signing ushered in a period of co-operation between the Congress and the League.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the war, Jinnah joined other Indian moderates in supporting the British war effort, hoping that Indians would be rewarded with political freedoms.
             Jinnah played an important role in the founding of the <em>All India Home Rule League</em> in 1916.
             Along with political leaders <em>Annie Besant</em> and Tilak, Jinnah demanded <em> "home rule"</em> for India—the status of a self-governing <em>dominion</em> in the Empire similar to Canada, New Zealand and Australia, although, with the war, Britain's politicians were not interested in considering Indian constitutional reform.
             British Cabinet minister <em>Edwin Montagu</em> recalled Jinnah in his memoirs, "young, perfectly mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with <em>dialectics</em>, and insistent on the whole of his scheme".
